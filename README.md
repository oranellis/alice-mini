# OPA Alice Mini

Circuit from the OPA Alice design by DJJules, which itself was based on the Alice microphone by Scott Helmke, this is a PCB designed for a 3D printed mic enclosure for the JLI-2555B Capsule. I started the project off the back of the DIYPerks video where Matthew made a gorgeous mic based on the same capsule, however I wanted to connect it to my Scarlet Focusrite Solo instead and stumbled on the Alice mic. 

## Design

The circuit is identical to the OPA Alice preamp circuit with the exception of using MLCC's instead of Aluminium electrolytic capacitors. It is designed in Kicad 8 with the JLCPCB [plugin](https://github.com/Bouni/kicad-jlcpcb-tools), and ordered pre-assembled from JLCPCB. This is my first PCB design so please scrutinise it thoroughly before using or ordering one for yourself. **THE BOARD HAS NOT ARRIVED FOR ME YET AND MAY HAVE ISSUES**, please wait until I update this with the information of whether it works or not. If it does work, I will design the 3D printed enclosure and add those files here (or a link to the onshape page).
